## Introduction
<h4>
   This a Node.js based app that is able to respond to emails sent to your Gmail mailbox while you don't have an access to your email or you are unavailable to respond.
</h4>
<h2>Method</h2>
To build this application I had to use express framework along with googleapis, googlecloud localauth modules and built it and deployed it using node.js. With the help of Gmail API provided by google cloud console I was able to get the access to the editing and reading rights of any mail id who avail the service of the app. I then had to generate oAuth2 credentials and with the help of that credentials I was able to make the API call. Once that was done we just had to seperate the undread mail after reading mailbox and tagging them into a different label and reply to all the senders.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

- The app identifies and isolate the email threads in which no prior email has been sent by you.
- It then sends appropriate reply to the sender that can be decided by us.
- After sending the reply, the email is tagged with a label in Gmail.
